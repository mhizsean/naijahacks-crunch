## Problem
  Nigeria is faced with a very high level of unemployment. Yet, most of these unemployed people have marketable skills. The problem is that they are unable to easily connect with the potential employers who require their skills within and outside the country.  Even when they do, the potential employers also face a significant uncertainty about the integrity and capability  of these skilled professionals and are skeptical of taking the chance. A considerable amount of energy and time is also spent by the employers in the process of finding the right professional. 

## Solution
  We are creating a platform that would connect validated skilled professionals with the employers in such a way that leads to the elimination of lack of trust and uncertainty in the system. The employers are sure of the integrity and capability of who they are hiring even without physically meeting them and the entire process can be done within few minutes. This saves the employers time and energy by getting these services with just a click. The skilled professionals, on the other hand, have the opportunity of leaving the unemployment zone through the connection to a  large potential market on the platform that seek their services. The platform will create a unique leverage for the skilled professionals so that they can fully tap into the potential of this connected audience to increase their income.
